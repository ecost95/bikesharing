## Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to review and analyze bikeshare data from Citibike to determine whether a bikeshare program would be profitable in Des Moines. We will be presenting a Tableau Story to stakeholders to seek an investment in Citibike. The visualizations will break down the rideshare user information in Manhattan, a city with similar demographics to Des Moines.

## Results:
Using Tableau, we were ableto create the following vizualizations to share with investors:

1) First, we showed a map of Manhattan with all trips represented as marks. We noted in a comment that there are more tourists in this are.

2) We added a line chart with total trip duration by age. We saw that overall, younger people had longer trip durations on the bikes.

3) We looked closer at the trip duration in this line chart. The majority of trips were 5 minutes in duration.

4) We broke down the trip duration even further by looking at checkout times by gender. We saw that there are similar trends between men and women.

5) We looked at a heatmap of user types. Most users are subscribers rather than one-time customers.

6) We checked peak checkout times by creating a heat map for peak checkout times by weekday hour. We saw that peak checkout was before and after working hours Thursday-Sunday.

7) Breaking this heatmap down by gender, we show that there are similar trends for men and women, with men checking out more bikes overall.

## Summary:

Looking at these vizualizations, we can see that the Citibike rideshare is very popular in Mahattan. It is especially poopular among younger riders, and the peak checkout times suggest that the bikes are used by professionals to commute to work. Furthermore, we can see that most reiders are subscribers, meaning that they will check out bikes more than once and bring in more revenue. We recommend that Des Moines consider investing in a rideshare program since they have similar demographics as Manhattan.
